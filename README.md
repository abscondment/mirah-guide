# Mirah Guide

This is a toy application demonstrating the use of
[Mirah](https://github.com/mirah/mirah) for Android Development. It
locates your device and then accesses
[the GeoNames API](http://www.geonames.org/export/wikipedia-webservice.html#findNearbyWikipedia)
to display the closest georeferenced Wikipedia articles.

## Prerequisites

You'll need the following:

 * The Android SDK installed & on your $PATH
 * Jruby 1.6.x
 * Mirah 0.0.9
